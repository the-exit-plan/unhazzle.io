# Matija (CoFounder/CTO https://www.ejcar.rs)

- (Him 1st question: Who is your target?) (My anwser: Startups and Scalups(less then 100 people but would not say no to bigger companies)
- I consider myself a poweruser so outside of IDE and some UIs(AWS) I spend mytime predominantly in CLI and ofter can't be botherthered with looking into docs all the time. I prefer it's available directly in terminal or better guided as most modern cli do this.
- Shorten the tool binary name, too long
- Support both flags and interactive terminal, (example unhazzle init should go through configuration questions)
- How do I host static assets?
- What is the persistance of logs?
- I like the GH actions generation part for easy deployment, be more clear on how to setup that (what needs to be done from my side)
- (asked about docker file) Not really needed if good examples are provided in the documentation
- Being able to replicate classic AWS serverless stack(AGW, Lambda, Mongo, btw is any NoSQL DB in plan) would maybe make it more attractive for startups as lot of them think of that 1st when they think "cheap".
- Can I create alerts for costs?
